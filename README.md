cd Parkinson-Digital-Biomarkers
```

### Option 1: Conda (recommended)
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mediapip_torch
```

### Option 2: pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📥 Data Access

The raw pickle data (~800 MB) are **too large for GitHub**.  
They are hosted externally and must be downloaded before running the feature extraction.

➡️ [Download Raw Data](https://your-link-to-download.com)

After downloading, place the file(s) into:
```
data/raw/
    └── video_keypoints.pkl
```

### 📦 Contents of `video_keypoints.pkl`

pickle file is a Python dictionary containing the following keys:

- **`video_path`**: List of video file paths corresponding to each sample.  
- **`distances`**: List of distance signals (thumb–index distance or angle) for each video.  
- **`keypoints`**: List of Mediapipe hand keypoints per frame (shape: frames × 21 landmarks × 3 coordinates).  
- **`id`**: Patient ID for each video.  
- **`label`**: Clinical MDS-UPDRS score (0–4).  
- **`fps`**: Frames per second of the corresponding video.

Example code to inspect the pickle file:

```python
import pickle

with open("data/raw/video_keypoints.pkl", "rb") as f:
    annotated_data = pickle.load(f)

print("Keys:", annotated_data.keys())
print("Number of samples:", len(annotated_data['video_path']))

# Example: show first entry
print("Video path:", annotated_data['video_path'][0])
print("Patient ID:", annotated_data['id'][0])
print("Label:", annotated_data['label'][0])
print("FPS:", annotated_data['fps'][0])
print("Distance signal length:", len(annotated_data['distances'][0]))
```

This file serves as the **input** for `feature_extaction.py`, which extracts motor features and saves them in `data/processed/combined_features.csv`.

## ▶️ Usage

### Preprocess Videos & Extract Features
```bash
python src/preprocessing/FT_myHC_savefeature_annotated.py
```
- Processes finger tapping videos with Mediapipe  
- Extracts keypoints and distance signals  
- Saves pickle & feature CSV files

### Feature Extraction
After downloading and placing `video_keypoints.pkl` in `data/raw/`, run:

```bash
python src/feature_extraction/feature_extaction.py

This will generate:
data/processed/combined_features.csv
